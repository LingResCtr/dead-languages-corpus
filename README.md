## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

TBD: What need motivated the creation of this dataset? What are some of the reasons underlying the major choices involved in putting it together?

### Source Data

The source data was the original web-based collection of language lessons on the Linguistics Research Center [website](https://lrc.la.utexas.edu/eieol).

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

[More Information Needed]

#### Who are the source language producers?

The data was originally produced and collected by humans.

### Personal and Sensitive Information

The authors of the texts have been dead for a millenium, and as such the dataset does not contain what we would consider PII. 

## Considerations for Using the Data

### Social Impact of Dataset

TBD: [More Information Needed]

### Discussion of Biases

The data represents societies from eras when sexism, racism, and ableism were the norm, and this may be reflected in a given dataset.
