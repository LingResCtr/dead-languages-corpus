## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

The goal of this project was to ensure that the LRC's data collection was accessible in a modern, open-source, and developer-friendly format.

### Source Data

The source data was the original web-based collection of language lessons on the Linguistics Research Center [website](https://lrc.la.utexas.edu/eieol).

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

[More Information Needed]

#### Who are the source language producers?

The data was originally produced and collected by humans. 

The lessons were originally compiled as part of a broader education project, and the authors were academics working at the University of Texas.

### Annotations

#### Annotation process

#### Who are the annotators?

### Personal and Sensitive Information

The authors of the texts have been dead for a millenium, and as such the dataset does not contain what we would consider PII. 

## Considerations for Using the Data

### Social Impact of Dataset

TBD: [More Information Needed]

### Discussion of Biases

The data represents societies from eras when sexism, racism, and ableism were the norm, and this may be reflected in a given dataset.

### Other Known Limitations
