After he heard that  the people were Trojans and their leader was Aeneas, the son of Anchises and Venus, and that  their city had been burned, and driven from their home they were seeking a dwelling place  and a site where they might build a city, in admiration of both the renown of the race and  the spirit of the hero who was prepared either for war or for peace, he gave him his right  hand and enacted a pledge of future friendship. A treaty was then struck by the leaders,  and the armies saluted. Aeneas received guest friendship with Latinus.

They have indeed among these all the rights as masters over slaves. Of these two classes the one consists  of Druids, the other of Knights. The former are concerned with divine worship; they handle public and private  sacrifices, and they interpret religious matters.

For they make decisions about almost all public and  private controversies, and if any crime has been committed, if a murder has been done, if there is controversy  about boundaries, they decide the same, they determine rewards and punishments. If any one, either private or  public, does not abide by their decree, they ban him from sacrifices. This punishment is the most serious among  them. ... It is said that they memorize a great number of verses (in the Druidic schools). And for that reason some  remain twenty years in training.

Rather, other tribes had furnished them by their own designations, and chiefly the Pelasgians.

It was not for a long time, however that the name would prevail for all clans. Homer especially demonstrated this. Although being much later than the times of Troy, he nowhere at all referred to them all together, nor to others than the followers of Achilles from Phthiotis.

As though it was not the beginning of autumn, to every other person except the newly-arrived general this monotonous rain would seem a sad coincidence. He was coming to Albania from a foreign state for the withdrawal of the bones of the soldiers killed in the last world war. The talks between the two governments had started in the spring, but the final contracts were only signed at the end of August, precisely at the time when the first cloudy skies began. Therefore it was autumn and the time of rain had come. The General knew this. Before he set out he had learned, among other things, something about the climate of Albania. The general knew that in Albania autumn is humid and rainy. However even though, in the book that he had read, it was written that in Albania autumn is sunny and dry, this rain would not have seemed unexpected. Quite the opposite. And the reason was that, to him, it had always seemed that his mission could only be accomplished in rain.</blockquote>  "}

But why did all the religious and moral motifs of eternal truth, goodness and beauty leave him as cold as ice, whereas creative lyric emotion led to the traps and dangers of life?</blockquote>  <blockquote>But at that moment the third possibility just began to become clear. His own practice had shown him that being a priest and poeticizing are two completely different, if not opposing vocations. Then why is it necessary to unite them? 'As a priest I am not a poet, and as a poet I am not a priest.' This is the formula with which Liudas Vasaris deceived himself for a long time. Like a drowning man (grasping) for a straw, he grasped for this psychological sophism, rather frequently encountered in various guises in life. For long years this illusion kept him afloat; he acted as a priest and acted as a poet, and at the same time the priest and poet in him were engaged in a desperate struggle. He wrote down many of the moments of this struggle and thought that he was creating poetry. At the same time he was writing the chronicle of his ruin, here and there marked by a true spark of creativity, the sad witness of his talent.</blockquote>  "}

They then set out, travelled, and reached the imperial palace of the kings of the Greeks. At about that time in matters of faith the great king of the Greeks, Valens, was under the sway of heresy of the Arians' sect. Then, when the king saw them, first he honored them with marvellous glory and great splendor. Then it happened that the only son of the emperor -- that one was truly considered his progeny -- had lapsed into the throes of a severe illness. On account of making prayers over the child, the king thereupon urged Nerses the holy catholicos of the Armenians.</blockquote>  <blockquote>[Nerses continues with a discussion of the content of the orthodox faith, and makes the son's healing dependent on the Arian king's acceptance of this doctrine. The following continues with the king's reply.]</blockquote>  <blockquote>And when the king heard all this -- for, while he was still speaking before him, he remained but silent, having set foot over foot, elbow on knee, and hand on chin -- he sat thus until he finished speaking all his words. And the notary archon's stenographers who were before the king transcribed this. Then the king fell fiercely into a rage, and gave an order to bind fast with iron chains Nerses the holy archbishop of the Armenians, and to cast him into prison.</blockquote>  "}

Then it occurred to them, granted by benevolent God, to collect the patriotic counsel of the blessed monks and to obtain letters of the alphabet for the Armenian people; having devoted themselves to a great examination of experiment and investigation, and having endured great labors, they then made an announcement of their own searching to the king of the Armenians, whose name was called Vramshapuh. Then the king told them about a certain man called Daniel by name, an Assyrian bishop of noble origin, who had elsewhere devised letters of the alphabet for the Armenian language. And when this was related to them by the king about the writing from Daniel, they prompted the king to take care according to their needs. And by decree he sent someone, Vahrich by name, to an elderly man whose name they called Habel, who was an acquaintance of the Assyrian bishop Daniel.</blockquote>  "}

It is like when one would be another's enemy, and having concealed his enmity, he would secretly wish to harm him; yet he would not know the nature of the harm, and having come he would wander around in search of means; then, having found the time when someone among the physicians would give an order to his adversary not to touch this thing, and not to taste such a type of food, by which he could arrive to health; and having heard of it, soon pretending under the guise of friendship, he would blame the healer; and, labelling the useful things as harmful to him, he would persuade him, and he would give directions contrary to the orders of the physician, and by this do him harm; and, if he did not recognize beforehand the nature of the harm, rather having found the cure in the physician's order, it was harmful. Thus it is thought also of Satan, his envying of the first-created man, and his not knowing the nature of the evil-doing; because, though there was no evil before, from which it was possible to recognize its nature, nevertheless having learned from God's commandment -- which was given to man to keep him from partaking of some deadly part of the plant -- he offered to man that which, though it was not a useless bit of food for man, and not by nature a deadly plant, nevertheless on this very count man was prohibited from partaking of this -- rather disobedience was the basis of death for man, as for a criminal who would disobey the dictum of an authority that would restrain him.</blockquote>  "}

Astonished at this, Abgar recognized him truly as son of God, and said: \"These marvels are not of man but of God, for there is no one among men who is able to raise the dead, save God alone.\" And because his own body was corrupted by terrible pains, which had befallen him in the land of the Persians seven years before, and which among men there was not for him a means of curing, he granted to be taken to him a letter of entreaty to come and cure him of his pains....</blockquote>  "}

They then set out, travelled, and reached the imperial palace of the kings of the Greeks. At about that time in matters of faith the great king of the Greeks, Valens, was under the sway of heresy of the Arians' sect. Then, when the king saw them, first he honored them with marvellous glory and great splendor. Then it happened that the only son of the emperor -- that one was truly considered his progeny -- had lapsed into the throes of a severe illness. On account of making prayers over the child, the king thereupon urged Nerses the holy catholicos of the Armenians.</blockquote>  <blockquote>[Nerses continues with a discussion of the content of the orthodox faith, and makes the son's healing dependent on the Arian king's acceptance of this doctrine. The following continues with the king's reply.]</blockquote>  <blockquote>And when the king heard all this -- for, while he was still speaking before him, he remained but silent, having set foot over foot, elbow on knee, and hand on chin -- he sat thus until he finished speaking all his words. And the notary archon's stenographers who were before the king transcribed this. Then the king fell fiercely into a rage, and gave an order to bind fast with iron chains Nerses the holy archbishop of the Armenians, and to cast him into prison.</blockquote>  "}

And thus inclined, assembled together, they rose up with powerful prayers to God for obtaining Christ-borne salvation for all the souls; and they continued to do this for many days. Then it occurred to them, granted by benevolent God, to collect the patriotic counsel of the blessed monks and to obtain letters of the alphabet for the Armenian people; having devoted themselves to a great examination of experiment and investigation, and having endured great labors, they then made an announcement of their own searching to the king of the Armenians, whose name was called Vramshapuh. Then the king told them about a certain man called Daniel by name, an Assyrian bishop of noble origin, who had elsewhere devised letters of the alphabet for the Armenian language. And when this was related to them by the king about the writing from Daniel, they prompted the king to take care according to their needs.

It is like when one would be another's enemy, and having concealed his enmity, he would secretly wish to harm him; yet he would not know the nature of the harm, and having come he would wander around in search of means; then, having found the time when someone among the physicians would give an order to his adversary not to touch this thing, and not to taste such a type of food, by which he could arrive to health; and having heard of it, soon pretending under the guise of friendship, he would blame the healer; and, labelling the useful things as harmful to him, he would persuade him, and he would give directions contrary to the orders of the physician, and by this do him harm; and, if he did not recognize beforehand the nature of the harm, rather having found the cure in the physician's order, it was harmful. Thus it is thought also of Satan, his envying of the first-created man, and his not knowing the nature of the evil-doing; because, though there was no evil before, from which it was possible to recognize its nature, nevertheless having learned from God's commandment -- which was given to man to keep him from partaking of some deadly part of the plant -- he offered to man that which, though it was not a useless bit of food for man, and not by nature a deadly plant, nevertheless on this very count man was prohibited from partaking of this -- rather disobedience was the basis of death for man, as for a criminal who would disobey the dictum of an authority that would restrain him.</blockquote>  "}

To the steppe, to the meadow, to the swamps he went. Telepenus went to the swamp and hid himself in the swamp. Over him the halenzu-plant grew. Therefore barley and wheat do not ripen. Cows, sheep, and humans do not get pregnant. And those who are already pregnant cannot give birth. The mountains and the trees dried up; and the foliage does not come out. The meadows and springs dried up; and, in the land, famine came to pass. Humans and gods are perishing from hunger. The Great Sun God prepared a feast and invited the Thousand Gods.

(Telepenus) constructed houses for them, (saying) \"Let them go and remain (there); let them eat and drink, and do no harm to them.\" And I (Telepenus) say: \"They harmed me, but I will not harm them.\" When I, Telepenus, seated myself upon the throne of my father, I went on a military campaign to Hassuwas and destroyed the city of Hassuwas. My army was also in Zizzilippas, and in Zizzilippas a battle occurred.</blockquote>  <blockquote>And now bloodshed became common even among the royal family itself. Istapariya, the queen, died. And afterwards it happened that Ammunas, the prince, died. And the 'men of the god' are saying: \"Look, in Hattusas, bloodshed has become common.\" Then I, Telepenus, summoned the council in Hattusas, (saying): \"From now on, in Hattusas, let no one do evil to a son of the royal family (or) use a dagger against him. A son of the first rank, a prince, only should become king. If there is no first-ranked prince, (then) let one who is of the second rank become king. If there is no royal male heir, let them take an <i>antiyant-man</i> for a first-ranked daughter, and let him become king. In the future, whoever becomes king after me, let his brothers, his sons, his relatives by marriage, the men of his family, and his army be united. Then you shall come with your strong arm and conquer the enemy's lands. And don't say the following: 'I will issue pardons.' You pardon nothing; you even order arrests! Do not kill anyone among the (royal) family. That is not good. Moreover, he who becomes king and seeks evil against brother (or) sister-you, are his advisory council. Tell him frankly: 'Study this story of bloodshed from the tablet. Previously bloodshed became common in Hattusas and the gods have placed it for you on the royal family.'\"</blockquote>  "}

He protected me, and he kept the oath which he had sworn and in no way did he turn aside (from his loyalty). But when the god took me, and I became king, then I made a treaty with Kuruntas as follows: those towns which were not placed on the treaty tablet of my father, those towns, along with field and meadow, (and) all deportees, I gave to Kuruntas (to hold) in vassalship.

(4) But there was a certain prince in the Czech Lands, Bratislav by name, and his wife was called Dragomira. (5) And having produced their first-born son, they christened him and gave him the name Venceslav. (6) And as he grew so big as to tonsure him, his father Bratislav invited to this tonsure a certain bishop, Notar by name, and his clerics with him. (7) And when they celebrated the mass for him in the Church of the Holy Maria, the bishop took up the boy, placed him on the top step before the altar, and blessed him, saying: (8) 'Lord God, Jesus Christ, bless this boy, as you have blessed all yours who are just.' (9) And so with a blessing he was tonsured. (10) And by this we believe that, with the blessing of that just bishop and by his prayers, the boy began to grow, protected by God's grace. (11) He learned well the Slavonic and Latin letters. (12) And when his father Bratislav died, the Czechs established Venceslav as prince upon his grandfather's throne. (13) And Boleslav, his brother, grew alongside him; both were still young. (14) But their mother Dragomira ruled the land, and adminstered to the people, while Venceslav was growing up; and when he was grown, he began himself to administer to his people. (15) But by the grace of God, prince Venceslav truly learned well not only letters, but was also filled by faith. (16) He would perform good deeds among all the poor, clothe the naked, nourish the hungry, take in strangers according to the word of the evangel. (17) He would not permit a widow to be disgraced -- he showed mercy to all people, rich or poor; he served those who served God, and adorned many churches with gold.</blockquote>  "}

(2) For Rostislav, the Moravian prince, roused by God, took counsel with his princes and with the Moravians, and sent to Tsar Michael, saying: 'Our people, having cast off paganism and conducting themselves according to Christian law, have no such teacher who would explain the true Christian faith to us in our own tongue, so that even the countries here, seeing this, might emulate us. (3) So send us, Master, such a bishop and teacher. (4) For always, into all countries, the good law flows from you.' (5) The Tsar, convening a counsel, summoned Constantine the Philosopher, and bade him hear this request, and said: 'Philosopher, I see that you are weary, and it does not suit you to go there. (6) But there is no one so able to fulfil this request as you.' (7) The Philosopher answered: 'Though tired and feeble in body, I will gladly go there if they have letters for their tongue.' (8) And the Tsar said to him: 'My grandfather, my father, and those many others, though they sought, could not produce this. (9) Then how could I produce it?' (10) But the Philosopher said: 'Then who is able to write speech in water? (11) or to produce for himself the name of a heretic?' (12) The Tsar replied to him, along with Varda, his uncle: 'If you wish it, then God may grant it to you, God who gives to all who ask with confidence and opens the door to those who knock.' (13) And the Philosopher went and, according to the old custom, set himself to prayer with his other companions. (14) And lo God soon appeared to him, heeding the prayers of his servants. (15) And thereupon he created letters and immediately began to write the word of the Evangel: (16) In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, and so forth.</blockquote>  "}

One of these was Swithulf, bishop in Rochester, and Ceolmund, a nobleman in Kent, and Bertulf, a nobleman in Essex, and Wulfred, a nobleman in Hampshire, and Elhard, bishop at Dorchester, and Eadulf, the king's thane in Sussex, and Bernuff, governor in Winchester, Egulf, the king's horse-thane, and many also with them, though I have named (only) the most distinguished.</blockquote>  <blockquote>In the same year the plunderers in East Anglia and Northumbria greatly harassed the land of the West Saxons around the southern shore with marauding bands, most of all with ships which they built many years before. Then King Alfred ordered (his men) to build long ships (to be used) against the (Danish) ships; they were almost twice as long as the others; some had 60 oars, some more. They were both swifter and steadier and also higher than the others; they were shaped neither on the Frisian nor on the Danish (model), but as it seemed -- to he himself -- they might be most useful. At a certain time of the same year there came six ships to (the Isle of) Wight, and did much mischief there, both in Devonshire and almost everywhere near the seacoast. Then the King ordered (his men) to go (out) with nine of the new ships; and they blocked the mouth of the river in front of the open sea. They rode out against them with three ships, and three (others) remained upwards of the river mouth on dry (ground); the men had gone away, up inland. They took two of the three ships at the outer river mouth, and slew the men, and the (other) one escaped; the men on it were also slain, except for five...</blockquote>  "}

Where an anxious night-watch often kept me on the prow of a ship when it drives beneath the cliffs. My feet were pressed cold, bound in frigid fetters by the frost; where sorrows sighed hot around my heart; hunger gnawed within, a sea-weary mood. The man does not know, to whom everything happens most happily on earth, how wretched I spent an ice-cold winter at sea in the paths of exile bereft of kinsmen... behung with icicles: the hail flew in showers. There I heard nothing but the sea roar, ice-cold billow, sometimes the song of a swan: I made for my own amusement the gannet's song and the water-bird's call for the laughter of men, mew singing for mead-drinking. Storms there pounded stony cliffs, where sea-swallow replied to them with frosted wings; often the eagle screamed dewey-winged. No protective kinsmen might cheer the poor in spirit. Because he trusts little who has experienced life's joy in cities, with perils few, proud and intoxicated, how often I must remain exhausted in the sea lane. Night's shadow grew dark, from the north it snowed, hoar-frost bound the soil; hail fell upon earth, the coldest of grains. Therefore it strikes now the thoughts of the heart, that I the humble streams, the tumult of sea waves myself should test; the mind's desire urges at all times the spirit to travel, so that I seek far hence the land of foreigners. Because (there) is not a man on earth so proud, nor of his gifts so generous, nor in youth quite so bold, nor in his deeds quite so valiant, nor to him his lord quite so gracious, that he never has anxiety (about) his sea travel, (or) to what end the Lord will bring him.</blockquote>  "}

Conchobar then, sitting in his chariot, and his daughter Deichtire, she being an adult. It is she who was charioteer to her father. Also the champions of the Ulstermen in their chariots, that is Conall and Loegaire and everybody else. Bricriu, too, (was) with them.</blockquote>  <blockquote>The birds go before them to their abode, over Sliab Fuait, over Edmand, over Brega. There would not be a dyke, nor a fence or a stone wall around the land in Ireland at that time, but (just) even fields. It was delightful and it was beautiful the flight and the singing of those birds. Nine units of twenty birds to them, a chain of silver between every two birds. Each unit of twenty separated in its flight, nine trails (there were) to them. Thus (it was) two birds that were before them, a yoke of silver between them. Three birds were separated from them by the night. They flew before them to the end of Bruig na Boinne. It is there that night was on the warriors of the Ulstermen. Then it pours big snow on them.</blockquote>  <blockquote>Conchobar said to his party that they should unyoke their chariots and that they should put a delegation to the seeking of shelter for them.</blockquote>  "}

I have added what later became more clear to me, and it now deals more fully with this or that story. And whatever is misstated in these histories, it should later be necessary to have that instead which should prove more correct.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>On the Settlement of Iceland</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Iceland was settled first from Norway in the days of Harald the Fair-Haired, son of Halfdan the Black, at that time -- according to the opinion and reckoning of my foster-brother Teit, a man I regard as very learned, son of the bishop Isleif; and of my uncle Thorkel, son of Gellir, who could remember a long time back; and of Thorith, daughter of Snorri the Chief, who was both greatly wise and steeped in tradition -- when Ivar, son of Shaggy-Breeches Ragnar, ordered Saint Edmund, king of the Angles, to be killed. And that was 870 years after the birth of Christ, as it is written in his story.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The Norwegian man was called Ingolf, who it&#39;s said had actually first travelled from there to Iceland, when Harald the Fair-Haired was 16 years old; and then on another journey a few years later. He settled south in Reykjavik. The place is called Ingolf&#39;s Head, east of Minthak&#39;s Shoal, where he first came to land; and Ingolf&#39;s Fell west of Ale-Force River, which he afterwards took possession of. At that time Iceland was covered with forest between mountain and beach.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>There were Christian men in this place, whom the Norwegians called &quot;papas&quot;. But they later went on their way, since they did not want to stay here with heathen men, and they left behind their Irish books and bells and croziers: in this way they were able to determine that they were Irish men.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>There was a very extensive migration of people out to here from Norway, up to the point when king Harald banned it, since it seemed to him to amount to a depopulation. Then they settled on this, that each man should pay the king five ounces of silver, and he should not be exempt from this, whosoever would journey here from there. And so it is said that Harald was king 70 years, and reached eighty years old. These have become the basis for the tax which is now called land-dues. Sometimes more were paid, sometimes less, until Olaf the Thick made definite that each man should pay the king a half mark, whoever would travel between Norway and Iceland, except women or those men whom he should exempt. So Thorkel, son of Gellir, told us.</blockquote>\n"}

But as time went by, the people diversified: some were good and very faithful, but far more took to the pleasures of the land and spurned God's command, and therefore God submerged the land in a flood, as well as all the creatures of the land, save those which were with Noah in the ark. After Noah's flood, eight men lived who settled the land and races descended from them, and just as before it happened that when the world was populated and settled, it occurred that the majority of the population preferred hunger for wealth and glory and set aside obedience to God, and this went so far that they no longer desired to speak the name of God. But who then could tell their children about God's great works? So it came about that they forgot God's name and in most places around the world a man could not be found who knew the details of his creator. But nonetheless God gave them earthly gifts, property and prosperity, which they should possess on the land. He also distributed wisdom so that they distinguished all the earthly things and all the details of the air and the earth which one could discern. They contemplated this and wondered what it might mean that the earth and the animals and the birds had the same nature in certain respects and nevertheless there was dissimilarity in type. One characteristic was that the earth was piled up in high mountaintops and there water sprang forth and there was no need to dig further for water than in deep valleys. And such are the animals and birds, so that it is equally far for the blood to the head or feet. Another feature of the earth is that each year greenery grows on the earth, and flowers, and in the same year it all falls and fades. And such are the animals and birds, so that hair and feathers grow upon them and fall off each year. The third characteristic of the earth is when it is opened and dug up, then the grass grows in the soil which is topmost on the earth. They likened the rocks and stones to the teeth and bones of living creatures. From this they reasoned that the earth could be living and have life of a certain sort, and they understood this, that she was exceedingly old in years and rich in character. She fed all the living creatures and took to herself all that died. For that reason they gave her a name and traced their ancestry to her.</blockquote>  "}

And as the third part of the night passed, Grettir heard great rumblings outside. It came up to the house and passed into the hall and struck with its heels, so that it creaked on every beam. This went on for a bit; then it went from the house and came to the doors. And as the door came open, Grettir watched as the thrall poked his head inside, and seemed to him hideously powerful and outlandishly huge. Glam advanced slowly and stood upright as he came inside through the doors. He extended right up to the roof. He turned to the hall and set his arm upon the crossbeam and peered in across the hall. The yeoman let no sound escape, and this seemed to him sufficient, when he heard what all was outside. Grettir lay quiet and moved not a bit. Glam noticed that some heap lay along the sideboards, and now made his way farther in along the hall and took a strong hold of the cloak. Grettir braced against the plank and did not move at all. Glam pulled a second time, much harder, but the cloak would not budge. The third time he grabbed hold with both hands so hard that he raised Grettir up from the sideboards; they rent the cloak asunder between them.</blockquote>  <blockquote>Glam looked at the rag which he was holding and was quite astonished that someone could pull so hard against him. And at that moment Grettir lept under his hands and grabbed round his midsection and wrapped round his back as tight as he could, as he intended that Glam should give way underneath. But the thrall laid hold of Grettir's arms so tight that he completely gave way on account of his strength. Grettir then slipped away from bed to bed. The planks shot from their settings, and all that came before them was broken. Glam wanted to find a way out, but Grettir would brace his feet everyplace he tried. At last Glam was able to drag him out from the hall. They had such a fierce struggle that the thrall thought to send him out of the house; but as difficult as it was to hold up against Glam inside, nevertheless Grettir saw that it was still worse to struggle with him outside, and for this he strove against his exit with all his might. Glam struck out with everything he had and pulled him to himself as they came to the hall vestibule. And as Grettir saw that he was not able to resist, he executed one fluid motion as he lept as hard as possible against the thrall's breast and kicked him with both feet against a stone set in the ground, which stood before the door. The thrall had not prepared himself for this; he had struggled to drag Grettir to himself, and at that Glam fell to the back and tumbled backwards out towards the door, so that his shoulders struck the lintel and the roof fell apart, both the beams and the frozen thatch; he fell over and backwards out of the house, and Grettir fell on top of him.</blockquote>  "}

Your dealings go the same way as it might turn out later.</blockquote>  <blockquote>Gunnhild said, 'I can see this, Arinbjorn, that you are more loyal to Egil than to King Eirik. If Egil should ride from here for a week in peace, then he might reach King Athalstan in that time. King Eirik need not deceive himself in this, that now all the kings have become more powerful than him; yet a short time ago that would not have been likely, that King Eirik should not have the desire or energy for this, to avenge his grievances on each man such as Egil is.'</blockquote>  <blockquote>Arinbjorn said, 'No man would call Eirik a greater man if he should kill a foreign farmer's son, who has come under his control. But if he wants to acquire fame from this, then I should assist him in this, so that these events will seem more worth telling, by the fact that Egil and I will now help each other, so that he shall deal equally with us both. You might, king, pay dearly for Egil's life, when we are all laid low, I and my followers; I would have expected different from you, than that you would be more willing to lay me on the ground than let me receive the life of one man which I request.'</blockquote>  <blockquote>Then the king says, 'You take great pains in this, Arinbjorn, to give Egil assistance. Reluctant might I be to do you harm, if it comes to that, if you would rather set aside your life than that he be killed. But there are sufficient causes against Egil, whatever I order to be done with him.'</blockquote>  <blockquote>And as the king had said that, Egil went before him and took up his poem and spoke loud and commanded silence:</blockquote>  <blockquote>Westward I rode out over the sea, and I bear the sea <br> of Odin's breast, as was my condition; <br> I dragged the oak afloat during the ice-breaking, <br> I loaded my mind's hold with a cargo of praise.</blockquote>  <blockquote>I offered myself to the king with hospitality, I have the duty of praise, <br> I bear Odin's mead to the lands of the Angles. <br> I have accomplished the prince's praise, certainly I should praise him, <br> I ask him for audience, since I have composed his praise.</blockquote>  <blockquote>Consider this, king, well would you do, <br> how I start to recite, if I obtain silence. <br> Many a man has heard what fights the king has fought, <br> and Odin saw where the slain lay.</blockquote>  <blockquote>The din grew of swords against the shield's rim, <br> the battle waxed round the king, the king pressed onward: <br> there was heard the prophecy of the metal-storm, <br> the sword's stream flowed, where it lay strongest.</blockquote>  <blockquote>[N.B. .

Bothvar then led his horse to the stall near the king's best horses and asked no one about it; he then went into the hall, where there were a few men. He set himself at a distance, and when he had been there a little while, he heard some rummaging over in a certain spot in the corner. Bothvar looked there and saw that a man's hand was coming up out of a great pile of bones which was lying there; the hand was quite black. Bothvar went over and asked who was there in the bone pile. Then came a reply, rather timidly: 'I'm called Hott, dear sir.' 'Why are you here', said Bothvar, 'and what are you doing?' Hott said, 'I'm arranging protection for myself, dear sir.' Bothvar said, 'You're pitiful at protecting yourself!' Bothvar seized him and snatched him up out of the bone pile. Hott cried aloud and said, 'Now you'll kill me! Don't do that -- just before I was quite secure, but now you've thrown asunder my protection; and I had just made it so high about me that it had protected me against all your blows, so no strikes had landed on me for some time, though it was not so secure as I had intended it should be.' Bothvar said, 'You'll no longer have use of this protection.' Hott wept and said, 'Will you kill me now, dear sir?' Bothvar told him not to be so loud, then took him up and carried him out of the hall and to some water which was nearby -- few took notice of this -- and washed him all up.</blockquote>  <blockquote>Then Bothvar went back to the place he had taken up before, and led Hott behind him and set Hott next to himself. But he was so frightened that his limbs and joints shook, even though he seemed to understand that this man would help him. Soon evening came on and men entered the hall, and Hrolf's troop saw that Hott was set up on a bench, and it seemed to them that this man had become rather daring to have done so. Hott made an expression of contempt when he saw his acquaintances, since he had met ill at their hands. He was eager to leave and go back to his bone pile, but Bothvar held him so he couldn't get away, since he seemed less exposed to their blows as he was now than if he be allowed to go thither. The retainers now took up their usual custom, and cast forth small bones across the floor at Bothvar and Hott. Bothvar acts as if he doesn't notice it. Hott is so frightened that he takes neither food nor drink, and it seems to him time and again that he might get hit. And then Hott says to Bothvar: 'Dear sir, now a great knuckle-bone is coming at you, and it might mean to do us harm.' Bothvar told him to be quiet. He set out an open palm and received the knuckle-bone -- the leg-bone followed. Bothvar sent back the knuckle-bone and directed it at the one who threw it -- straight at him with so hard a blow that he caught his death. A great fear came over the retainers.</blockquote>  <blockquote>Now this news came to king Hrolf and his champions up in the castle, that an imposing man had arrived at the hall and had slain one of his retainers, and they wanted to be permitted to slay the man. King Hrolf asked in return whether the retainer had been slain without cause. 'Nearly so,' they said. Then the whole truth came out before king Hrolf. King Hrolf said it to be far from the case that they should kill the man -- 'You have taken up a bad habit here, to strike blameless men with bones; it is a disgrace for me, but a great shame for you, to do so. I have spoken often about that before, and you have paid it no heed, and I suspect this man, whom you have just attacked, might be no trifle compared to you. So summon him to me, so I might know who he is.'</blockquote>  <blockquote>Bothvar goes before the king and greets him with courtesy. The king asks him for his name. 'Your retainers call me Hott's-guard, but I'm named Bothvar.' The king said, 'What compensation will you give me for my retainer?' Bothvar said, 'He got what he deserved.' The king said, 'Will you become one of my men and take his place?' Bothvar said, 'I wouldn't refuse to be one of yours, but we shall not part as matters stand, Hott and I, but will both stay nearer you than that man had been sitting; otherwise we'll both be on our way.' The king said, 'I see no honor in him, but I would not deny him food.'</blockquote>  <blockquote>Bothvar now goes to the spot which pleases him, but he does not wish to occupy the one which that man had before. He snatches up three men in a certain spot and he and Hott set themselves down there farther in the hall than was designated for them. The men consider Bothvar difficult to deal with, and they hold great resentment toward him.</blockquote>  <blockquote>And as it came toward yule time, the men became depressed. Bothvar asks Hott what this all amounts to; he tells him that a certain animal had come there two winters in a row, big and terrible -- 'and it has wings on its back and it flies continuously. For two autumns now it has visited here and done great damage. No weapons cut it, nor do the king's champions come home, those who are greatest of all.' Bothvar said, 'The hall is not as well built as I had thought, if one animal will destroy the king's kingdom and property.' Hott said, 'That is no animal, but the greatest troll.'</blockquote>  <blockquote>It came to Christmas Eve. The king said, 'Now I want that my men be quiet and silent during the night, and I forbid all my men to go into certain danger against the animal, but the livestock fares according to whatever happens; I will not lose my men.' They all promise good behavior, to work according to what the king commanded.</blockquote>  <blockquote>Bothvar stole away during the night; he makes Hott go with him, and he does so unwillingly, and claimed it would be his death. Bothvar says that that might turn out better. They go away from the hall, and Bothvar ends up carrying him, so afraid is he. Suddenly they see the animal, and right then Hott cried out such as he could and said the animal would swallow him. Bothvar commanded this dog of his to be silent and cast him down upon the moss, and there he lay , not completely unafraid. Nor did he dare to go home. Then Bothvar goes to meet the animal; it happens that his sword is stuck fast in the scabbard as he wishes to draw it. Bothvar now tugs hard on the sword and shakes the scabbard, and now tries a sudden jerk of the scabbard so that the sword comes out of the sheath and he thrusts it quickly under the animal's shoulder so hard that it stuck in its heart, and the animal dropped down dead to the earth. After that he goes back where Hott is lying. Bothvar takes him up and carries him to where the animal lies dead. Hott shakes violently. Bothvar said: 'Now you shall drink the animal's blood.'</blockquote>  <blockquote>[N.B. Hott comes back from the escapade a changed man, with a renewed sense of confidence.]</blockquote>  "}

She passed through the fires and smoke, <br /> until she came to the mound of the berserkers. Then she said:</blockquote>  <blockquote>'Wake, Angantyr! Hervor wakes you, <br /> sole daughter of you and Tofa. <br /> Give out from the grave your sharp sword, <br /> which dwarfs hammered out for Svafrlami.</blockquote>  <blockquote>Hervarth, Hjorvarth, Hrani, Angantyr! <br /> I wake you all below the tree's roots, <br /> with helmet and byrnie, with sharp sword, <br /> with shield and harness, with reddened spear.</blockquote>  <blockquote>You, sons of Arngrim, violent kin, <br /> have changed greatly for the heaping up of earth, <br /> while none of the sons of Eyfura will <br /> speak with me in Munarvag.</blockquote>  <blockquote>So be it for you all within your ribs, <br /> as if you waste away in an ant hill, <br /> unless you give the sword which Dvalin hammered; <br /> it is not fitting for ghosts to hide the precious weapon.'</blockquote>  <blockquote>Then Angantyr answered: <br /> 'Hervor, my daughter, why do you call out so, <br /> filled with curses? It works to your disadvantage. <br /> You have become mad and senseless; <br /> delirious, you wake dead men!</blockquote>  <blockquote>A father did not bury me, nor other kin. <br /> They held Tyrfing, the two who lived, <br /> though at last only one became the owner.'</blockquote>  <blockquote>She said: <br /> 'Tell it true: so the God should leave you <br /> whole in the mound, if you do not have <br /> Tyrfing with you! You are reluctant to give <br /> the inheritance to your only child.'</blockquote>  <blockquote>Then it was as if a single flame was to be seen all around the graves, <br /> which stood open. Then Angantyr said:</blockquote>  <blockquote>'The door to hell is open, graves lie open, <br /> all the island's surface is seen to be on fire; <br /> it is fearsome to behold all about. <br /> Hasten, maiden, if you can, to your ships!\"</blockquote>  <blockquote>She said: <br /> \"You could not light fires in the night, <br /> so that I am frightened by your flames; <br /> the maiden's thought-enclosure does not tremble, <br /> though she see a ghost stand at the door.\"</blockquote>  <blockquote>Then Angantyr said: <br /> \"I tell you, Hervor, listen for the moment, <br /> prince's daughter, to what will be; <br /> This Tyrfing will, if you can believe, <br /> maiden, destroy your entire family.</blockquote>  <blockquote>You will have a son who will later <br /> carry Tyrfing and trust his might; <br /> People will call him Heithrek, <br /> he will be born most magnificent under the sun's pavilion.\"</blockquote>  <blockquote>She said: <br /> \"I lay a spell on dead men, so <br /> that you shall all lie <br /> dead with the ghosts, rotten in your grave; <br /> Give, Angantyr, out from the grave <br /> the dwarfs' work! It is not fitting for you to hide it.\"</blockquote>  <blockquote>He said: <br /> \"I declare you, young maiden, unlike to men, <br /> as you go from the mounds in the night <br /> with an inlaid spear and the Goths' metal, <br /> with helmet and byrnie before the doors of the hall.\"</blockquote>  <blockquote>She said: <br /> \"I seemed man enough til the point <br /> when I decided to seek your halls; <br /> give up from your grave that which cuts mail, <br /> that danger to shields, Hjalmar's bane!\"</blockquote>  <blockquote>Angantyr said: <br /> \"Hjalmar's bane lies beneath my shoulders, <br /> it is wrapped all about by fire; <br /> nowhere on earth do I know a maiden <br /> such as would dare take this sword in hand.\"</blockquote>  <blockquote>She said: <br /> \"I might care for and take in hand <br /> the sharp sword, if I could have it; <br /> I do not fear burning fire -- <br /> at once the flame sinks as I look upon it.\"</blockquote>  <blockquote>He said: <br /> \"You are foolish, Hervor, but possessed of courage, <br /> as you rush wide-eyed into the fire; <br /> instead I will give the sword from out of the grave, <br /> young maid, I cannot refuse.\"</blockquote>  <blockquote>She said: <br /> \"Well you did, viking kin, <br /> as you gave me the sword from the grave; <br /> I seem now, prince, to be better off, <br /> than if I should possess all of Norway.\"</blockquote>  <blockquote>He said: <br /> \"You do not understand -- you are hapless in your causes, <br /> deceitful woman -- what the celebration will be for; <br /> This Tyrfing will, if you can believe, <br /> maiden, destroy your entire family.\"</blockquote>  <blockquote>She said: <br /> \"I will go to my ocean-steeds; <br /> now the prince's maid is in good spirits; <br /> little does that frighten me, princes' kin, <br /> how my sons contend hereafter.\"</blockquote>  <blockquote>He said: <br /> \"You shall have and enjoy it for a long time, <br /> keep Hjalmar's bane in the sheath, <br /> do not touch the edges, poison is upon both; <br /> it dispenses man's fate worse by disease.</blockquote>  <blockquote>Fare well, daughter! Readily would I give you <br /> the life of twelve men, if you could believe, <br /> the strength and endurance, everything good, <br /> which Arngrim's sons left after them.\"</blockquote>  <blockquote>She said: <br /> \"Be you all -- the journey calls me -- <br /> safe in the grave! I must quickly hence. <br /> Now most of all I seemed between worlds, <br /> as fires burned around me.\"</blockquote>  "}

<br /> nine regions I recall, nine giantesses, <br /> the famous measure-tree beneath the soil.</blockquote>  <blockquote><sup>3</sup> It was early in time, when Ymir settled, <br /> there was no sand nor sea nor cold waves; <br /> no earth was to be found nor heavens above, <br /> there was a chasm of void, still grass nowhere.</blockquote>  <blockquote><sup>4</sup> First the sons of Bur raised the earth, <br /> the ones who shaped the great Midgard; <br /> the sun shone from the south along the ground's stones, <br /> then was the soil overgrown with green plants.</blockquote>  <blockquote><sup>5</sup> The sun, the moon's companion, cast from the south <br /> its right hand round heaven's rim; <br /> the sun knew not where she held lodging, <br /> the stars knew not where they had dwellings, <br /> the moon knew not what deal of strength he had.</blockquote>  <blockquote><sup>6</sup> Then all the powers went to the seats of judgement, <br /> sacred gods, and deliberated on that: <br /> to night and the moon's phases they gave names, <br /> they named morning and midday, <br /> afternoon and evening, to count out the years.</blockquote>  <blockquote><sup>7</sup> The Aesir met in Ithavale, <br /> where they constructed high houses and sanctuary, <br /> set hearths, forged treasures, <br /> shaped tongs and fashioned tools.</blockquote>  <blockquote><sup>8</sup> They played tables on the stead, were merry, <br /> they had no lack of anything golden, <br /> until came three of the giants' maids, <br /> quite powerful, from Giantland.</blockquote>  <blockquote><sup>9</sup> Then all the powers went to the seats of judgement, <br /> sacred gods, and deliberated on that, <br /> who should fashion the dwarfs' lord, <br /> from Brimir's blood and from Blain's limbs.</blockquote>  <blockquote><sup>10</sup> There Motsognir became the greatest <br /> of all the dwarfs, and Durin second; <br /> they fashioned many a human form <br /> from the earth, those dwarfs, as Durin said.</blockquote>  <blockquote><sup>11</sup> New-moon and Waned-moon, North and South, <br /> East and West, Great-thief, Delayer, <br /> Bivor, Bavor, Bombur, Nori, <br /> An and Anar, Great-grandfather, Mead-wolf.</blockquote>  <blockquote><sup>12</sup> Liquor and Staff-elf, Wind-elf and Thrain, <br /> Known and Thorin, Thror, Color and Wise, <br /> Corpse and New-counsel -- now I have <br /> -- Regin and Counsel-sharp -- rightly reckoned the dwarfs.</blockquote>  <blockquote><sup>13</sup> Fili, Kili, Foundling, Nali, <br /> Haft,

lineages in families up to Lofar, <br /> those who sought from the hall's stone <br /> the seats of muddy fields at Stonyvales.</blockquote>  <blockquote><sup>15</sup> There was Draupnir and

nor had they voice, <br /> blood nor bent, nor good bearing; <br /> Odin gave breath, Hoenir gave voice, <br /> Lothur gave blood and good bearing.</blockquote>  <blockquote><sup>19</sup> I know an ash to stand, it's name Yggdrasil, <br /> a high tree, watered with white-mud; <br /> thence comes the dew, which falls in the dale, <br /> green it stands ever over the well of fate.</blockquote>  <blockquote><sup>20</sup> Thence come three maids, knowing much, <br /> from the sea which stands under the tree; <br /> Fate they called one, Becoming the second <br /> -- they scribbled on staves --, Shall the third; <br /> they fixed the fates, they cut the course <br /> for the ages' children, the destinies of warriors.</blockquote>  <blockquote><sup>21</sup> She remembers that fight first in the land, <br /> when they studded Gullveig with spears <br /> and in Grey-hair's hall burned her; <br /> thrice they burned her, thrice reborn <br /> again and again, though she still lives.</blockquote>  <blockquote><sup>22</sup> The called her Bright, where she came to houses, <br /> right-speaking seeress, spirits she conjured; <br /> she prophesied, wherever she could, crazed she prophesied, <br /> ever was she the delight of a wicked wife.</blockquote>  <blockquote><sup>23</sup> Then all the powers went to the seats of judgement, <br /> sacred gods, and deliberated on that, <br /> whether the Aesir should pay tribute <br /> or whether all the gods should receive offerings.</blockquote>  <blockquote><sup>24</sup> Odin let loose and shot among the people, <br /> that was the first fight in the land; <br /> broken was the board wall of the Aesir's barricade, <br /> the death-proclaiming Vanir could tread the vale.</blockquote>  <blockquote><sup>25</sup> Then all the powers went to the seats of judgement, <br /> sacred gods, and deliberated on that, <br /> who had mixed all the air with misfortune <br /> or given Od's maid to the giant's race.</blockquote>

for this all men <br> have not become equally wise, <br> half mankind is everywhere.</blockquote>  <blockquote><sup>54</sup> Moderately wise <br> should each man be, <br> never let him be too wise;

cow; <br> I saw the fire flame up <br> before a wealthy man, <br> and outside was death before the doors.</blockquote>  <blockquote><sup>71</sup> The lame man rides a horse, <br> the one-armed man drives a flock, <br> the deaf man fights and wins; <br> the blind man is better, <br> though he be burned: <br> no one benefits from a corpse.</blockquote>  <blockquote><sup>72</sup> A son is better,

destroyers are two, <br> the tongue is the head's death, <br> in every coat for me <br> there's expectation of a hand.</blockquote>  <blockquote><sup>79</sup> The unwise man, <br> if he gets for himself <br> money or a woman's love, <br> his pride grows, <br> but never his sense, <br> he goes straight ahead to folly.</blockquote>  <blockquote><sup>80</sup> Then it is proven, <br> what you ask

It was commanded that all foreign men should seek their homeland, men should seek their home districts, according to the messengers of their lord, that each should come to the clan thence, where his kin was from, born from the cities.</p>\n\n<p>348-349a.) The order was carried out over this wide world.</p>\n\n<p>349b-350a.) People gathered at each of the cities.</p>\n\n<p>350b-352a.)

Then that was made known to many, over this wide world, to the wardens who perceived it, those who were horse wards there outside, men on watch tending the horses, animals in the field they saw the darkness split in two in the sky, and the light of God came gleaming through the clouds and enveloped the wardens there in the field.</p>\n\n<p>393b-401.) They became afraid then, the men in their hearts: they saw there a mighty angel of God coming, who spoke to them in reply, commanded that the wardens not be afraid of anything evil from the light: &#39;I shall&#39;, he said, &#39;tell you very truly of more beloved things, of welcome things, make known great power: now Christ is born on this same night, the holy child of God, in the city of David, the good Chieftain.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>4022-403a.) &#39;That is the joy of mankind, the advantage of all men.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>403b-409a.) &#39;There you can find him, the most powerful of children, in Bethlehem: you have that as a sign, that I may tell you with true words, that he lies there swaddled, the child in a manger, even though he is king over all of the earth and heaven, and over the children of the people, Ruler of the world.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>409b-413.) Right as he spoke those words, there came a great number of angels to them alone, holy army from the heavenly meadow, the fair folk of God, and they spoke much, many words of praise to the Lord of the peoples.</p>\n\n<p>414-415a.) They raised then a holy song, then they flew through the clouds back to the heavenly meadow.</p>\n\n<p>415b-422a.) The wardens heard how they praised the almighty God through the power of the angels in a very worthy manner with words: &#39;Now be glory,&#39; they said, &#39;to the Chieftain himself in the highest kingdom of the heavens and peace on earth for the children of the people, to men of good will, to those who recognize God through a clean heart.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>422b-426.)

Yet each holy man then might recognize Christ there, though it was not yet made known to the men of the king&#39;s court, those who were not obedient in their spirits, but it was hidden from them from then on with words and works, until men from the east, very wise men, came traveling there, three of them to the people, brave thanes, on a long journey over land thither: they followed a bright sign and sought the child of God with a sincere heart: they wanted to bow down to Him, to affirm Him to the followers: the fates of God urged them onwards.</p>\n\n<p>548.) Then they found powerful Herod there sitting in his hall, the cruel king, malicious with his men - he was fond of murder - then they spoke to him humbly in a manner befitting a king, courteously in his hall, and he asked immediately, which mission might have led them abroad, men on the path of exile: &#39;To which man do you bring gold arm ring as a gift? Why do you come thusly on the way, traveling by foot?&#39;</p>\n\n<p>556b.) &#39;Lo, I do not know from where you have traveled, earls from other peoples.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>557b.) &#39;I see that you are of noble birth from good kin: never before had such as you come here from other peoples, since I could rule this folk of earls, rule this wide realm.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>560b.) &#39;You of this people shall tell me truly, why you have come to this land.&#39; &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>562.) Then the men from the east spoke to him in reply, men wise in words: &#39;We may easily tell you truly&#39;, they said, &#39;of our mission, say truthfully, why we came on this path hither, from the east to this land.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>566b.) &#39;There were always noble men, well-spoken men, who promised us so much goodness, help from the Heavenly King, with true words.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>569b.) &#39;Then there was a wise man, experienced and very wise, - that was long ago-, our ancestor far in the east, - since then there has not been any man so wise of speech, - he could interpret the message of God, for the Lord of the peoples had granted this to him, that he could hear the word of the Ruler from above the earth: because of this his knowledge was great, the thoughts of the thane.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>576b.) &#39;Then he had to give up dwellings, the crowd of relatives, leave the joy of the people, to seek the other light, the he commanded his followers to come closer, the heirs, and then told his earls truthfully, - all that came later, happened in this world, - then he said that a wise king should come into this world by the best of births; said that it would be the Child of God, said that he would rule this world, the earth and heaven, always for eternity.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>587.) He said that on the same day, then a mother might bear him, the Blessed One into this world, so he said that a brilliant heavenly star would shine from the east, such as we here would never have had before between earth and heaven or anywhere else; nor such a Child, nor such a sign.</p>\n\n<p>592a.) He commanded that three men from the people travel there to pray, commanded them consider well, when they earlier would see the sign of God coming up from the east, commanded them make ready immediately, commanded that we follow it, as it would go forth, westwards over the world.</p>\n\n<p>597b.) Now it is all proven true, come about through the power of God: the king is born, born brave and strong: we saw his sign shining brightly from the stars of heaven, so I know that the holy, mighty Chieftain marked it himself.</p>\n\n<p>601b.) Each morning we say the bright star shining, and we went after the sign hither for a long time, on roads and through forest.</p>\n\n<p>630-654.)</p>\n\n<p>630.) Then I heard that immediately after this the cruel king spoke the message of the prophets to the foreign men, those earls who had traveled far there, into the foreign land, and he asked after this, about when on paths from the east&nbsp; they first saw the king&#39;s star coming, a sign shining brightly from heaven.</p>\n\n<p>636b.) They did not want to conceal anything of it from him then, but told it to him truly.</p>\n\n<p>637b.) Then he commanded them travel on the way, commanded that they should investigate fully their errand concerning the coming of this Child, and the king himself bade the wise men very sternly, the lord of the Jews, before they would travel forth from the west, that they would make it known to him as well, where he might look for the king at his dwelling; said that he wanted to pray to the Child there with his retinue.</p>\n\n<p>644b.) Then he thought to become his murderer, with the edges of a weapon.</p>\n\n<p>645b.) Then the Ruler God worked against the decision; he could accomplish more, carry out this light: that is still manifest for a long time, the power of God made known.</p>\n\n<p>648b.) Then the signs went forth, gleaming under the clouds.</p>\n\n<p>649b.) Then the wise men were eager to travel: they went forth thence, bold in the message: they wanted to look for the Child of God himself.</p>\n\n<p>652b.) They did not have any more companions, except that they were three: they knew about these things, they were wise men, who brought the gifts.</p>\n"}

Then he let himself hunger, so that after the forty nights he began to desire food in his humanity, the enemy came closer, the dark criminal: he hoped that be would be truly a mere man, spoke to him then with his words, the spear-enemy addressed him: &#39;If you be the Son of God&#39;, he said &#39;why do you not then command, if you have the power, the best of all children, these stones to become bread?

Then he went, the Mighty One, up onto a mountain, the most powerful of children to sit alone, and he chose, for himself, counted twelve loyal men, good men, whom he, the Chieftain, wanted as followers for himself from then on, every day, to have them always in his retinue.</p>\n\n<p>1255.) He called them then by name and commanded them then to come closer to him, first Andrew and Peter, the two brothers, and together with them James and John: they were dear to God; he was friendly to them in his spirit; they were sons of one man, both by birth, the Child of God chose them, good among the disciples and many men, more famous men: Matthew and Thomas, both Jude and Judas, and the other James, his own cousin: they had come from two sisters, from a clan, Christ and the good close relatives.</p>\n\n<p>1266b-1277a.) Then the Saving Christ had counted nine of the of the men there, loyal men: then he also commanded the tenth one to come, he himself with the followers: he was called Simon; he called Bartholomew to come also up on the mountain from the other people, and Philip with him, loyal men.</p>\n\n<p>1272b.) Then they went, twelve altogether, warriors to the meeting, where the counselor sat, protector of many, who would help all mankind against the distress of hell, protect against perdition, for whom he will carry out the beautiful teaching, as he though to show the people there through his great knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>1279-1380.)</p>\n\n<p>1279.) Then certain companions came closer around the Saving Christ as he chose for himself, the Ruler among the people.</p>\n\n<p>1281b.) Wise men stood very eagerly around the Son of God, men according to their will: they needed words, they thought and were silent, for what they Chieftain of the people, the Ruler himself, would make known to them with words, to this people in love.</p>\n\n<p>1286b.) Then the shepherd of the land sat face to face before the men, God&#39;s own Child wanted to teach the people with his speech, many wise words, how they should praise God in this worldly realm.</p>\n\n<p>1291.) Then he sat and remained silent and looked at them for a long time, he was merciful to them in his heart, the holy Chieftain, gentle in his spirit, and then opened his mouth, the Son of the Ruler taught with words, many wonderful things and spoke to the men with wise words, to those whom he, Christ the Ruler of all, had chosen there according to their speech, who would be the most worthy to God of all humanity, of the kin of man; he then told them truly, said that those would be blessed, men on this earth, who were poor here in their spirit through humility: to those the eternal kingdom is given, very holy eternal life in the heavenly meadow.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>1304b.) He said that also meek men would be blessed: &#39;those will possess the glorious land, the same kingdom.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>1306b.) He said that those who lament their evil deeds here would be blessed; &#39;they will eagerly expect comfort in the kingdom of their Lord.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>1308b.) &#39;Also blessed are they who long for good deeds here, men, that they might judge rightly.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>1309b.) &#39;Because of this they will be in the kingdom of the Chieftain, fulfilled through their deeds: they will attain such good things, those men who judge rightly here, do not want to deceive during counsel, men where they sit at the meeting place.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>1312b.) &#39;Also blessed are those, who become merciful in spirit here, in the hearts of men; to those, the mighty holy Chieftain himself will be merciful.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>1314b.) &#39;Also blessed among these many peoples are those who have purified their hearts: those will see the Ruler of heaven in his kingdom.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>1316b.) He said that those would be also blessed, &#39;who live peacefully among this people and do not want to work any strife, crimes with their own deeds: those will be named sons of the Chieftain, for he will be merciful to them; because of this they will long enjoy the same in his kingdom.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>1320b.) He said that also those men would be blessed, who desire righteousness, &#39;and through that endure the hate and harmful speech of more powerful men: the meadow of God is also given in heaven to those and spiritual life afterwards in eternity, so that no end of his blissful estate ever comes.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>1325b.) Then the Ruler Christ had told eight things there before the earls, spoken beatitudes, with them everyone shall&nbsp; reach the heavenly kingdom, if he will have it, or afterwards he shall lack riches and joys in eternity, after he gives up this world by earthly fate and seeks the other light, either beloved or evil, as he acts here with these people in this world; all as he spoke it then there with his words to his followers, the all-ruling Christ, the most powerful of kings, God&#39;s own Child: &#39;You will be blessed as well&#39;, he said, &#39;because of this people across this land will accuse you in court cases and speak slander; they will have scorn for you, work harm in this world and carry out punishment; they will inflict curses and enmity upon you; slander your teaching, do you great harm because of your Lord.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>1342b.) &#39;Because of this always let go of your heart, life in desires, for the reward stands prepared for you in God&#39;s kingdom; every good thing great and manifold: that is given for you as a reward, because you earlier endured trouble here, suffering in this world.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>1347b.) &#39;Worse is it for the others, those who possess good things here, wide worldly property, to those are given grimmer things: they partake of their delights here; they will enjoy enough of these, men shall in turn endure narrower things after their death.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>1352.) &#39;Then they shall weep there in misery, those who have joys here for a long time; they live in all pleasures, they do not want to leave any of this, sinful thoughts; because of this it urges them to more evil deeds in their minds.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>1355b.) &#39;Then that reward will come to them, evil and painful; then they shall see its end in despair.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>1357b.) &#39;Then they will become afflicted in spirit, because of this they obey so much of the will of this world, men in their thoughts.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>1359b.) &#39;You shall now rebuke them for that crime, prohibit with words, as I may now show you, my companions, tell truly with true words, that you shall be the salt of this world from now on for more sinful men, heal their evil deeds, so that they, the people, might receive better things and leave the work of the enemy, deeds of the devil, and seek the kingdom of their Chieftain.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>1367.) &#39;So you shall convert many people with your teachings, according to my will.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>1368b.) &#39;If anyone then turns away from you, leaves that teaching which he shall carry out, then he is as salt, that one scatters widely by the lake side: then it does not come to anything, but the children of the people trample it underfoot, men on the sand.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>1373b.) &#39;So it will happen to him, who shall glorify the word of God among men: if he then lets his heart doubt, so that he would not want to urge towards the heavenly kingdom with a clean heart, with his speech, and speak the message of God, but departs from those words; then the Ruler will become hostile to him, mightily angry, thus likewise for the children of men; then he will act the same towards all humanity, forsake the people, if they do not fulfill his teaching.&#39;</p>\n"}
