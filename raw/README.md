Each zip file in this folder is a database dump from the Linguistics Research Center at
UT Austin. They are named after the date on which the dump was created, so that we can
track changes over time. By running the Bash script [convert.sh](../convert.sh), you can
transform these zip files into more usable JSON-line format files in the [final](../final)
folder.
